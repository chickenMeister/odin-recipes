    <h4>Description</h4>
     
    <p>This colcannon recipe uses leeks and green cabbage but it tastes equally delicious with kale.

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <un>
            <li>1 pound potatoes</li>
            <li>1 pound green cabbage, sliced</li>
            <li>2 small leeks, cleaned and thinly sliced</li>
            <li>1 cup milk, or as needed</li>
            <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1 pinch ground mace</li>
            <li>Â½ cup butter</li>
        </un>

    <h4>Steps</h4>

    <ol>
        <li>Place potatoes in a large pot and cover with salted water; bring to a boil.
            Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, about 15 to 20 minutes.
            Drain.</li>
        <li>While potatoes are boiling, simmer or steam cabbage in a separate pot until tender.
            Drain and chop; set aside and keep warm.</li>
        <li>Place leeks in a small pot; add just enough milk to cover. 
            Simmer over low heat until leeks are soft, about 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Season potatoes with salt, pepper, and mace; mash well. Stir in cooked leeks and milk. 
            Stir in cabbage and heat through until potatoes are pale green in color. 
            Make a well in the center of the colcannon and pour in the melted butter. 
            Mix well and serve.</li>   
    </ol>
